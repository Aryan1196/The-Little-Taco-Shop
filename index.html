    <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
    <aside>
        <details>
            <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States</summary>
            <p>Tacos first appeared in the United States around 1905, brought by Mexican migrants who came to work on railroads and in mines. At the time, they were considered a cheap and portable street food, sold by vendors—often women known as "Chili Queens"—in cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio.

Early on, these tacos were soft corn tortillas with spicy fillings, and were seen as an exotic food by many Americans. The hard-shell taco that is common today was a later American innovation, developed in the 1940s and popularized by fast-food chains like Taco Bell in the 1960s to make the dish easier to mass-produce and serve.</p>
